### Office Hours Calendar


## <a name="schedule"></a> Schedule

The schedule below outlines topics, due dates, and links to assignments. We'll
typically update the material for the upcoming week before Monday's lecture so
you can see what's coming.

### Week 1 – Strings, Memory and Bitwise Representations (in C)

- **Announcements**

- **Readings**

- **Lecture Materials**

- **Discussion Materials**

## Syllabus

There are several components to the course:

- **Lab sessions**
- **Lab reports**
- **Lecture sessions**
- **Discussion sessions**
- **Programming**
- **Exams**

### Labs and Lab Reports

The course's lab component meets for 4 hours. In each lab you'll switch between
working on your own, working in pairs, and participating in group discussions
about your approach, lessons learned, programming problems, and so on.

Each lab has a dual theme:

- Combining small functions and programs from the week's practice into a larger
  application
- Learning development tools and techniques for managing, debugging, and
  testing your codebases

The lab sessions and groups will be led by TAs and tutors, who will note your
participation in these discussions for credit. Note that you must
**participate**, not merely **attend**, for credit.

If you miss lab, you'll still be held accountable for understanding the
relevant material via Exams and Assignments. You can miss one lab without it
impacting your grade (see [Grading](#grading) below). There is no way to make
up a lab, even for illness, travel, or emergencies. My preference would be to
require all 5 labs for an A, and have some kind of excused absences. However,
tracking excused absences doesn't really scale, so the “one for any reason”
policy is how we handle it. You don't need to justify your missed labs. Contact
the instructor if you'll miss more than 1 lab for unavoidable reasons.

A few days after lab, a _lab report_ will be due. Lab reports will have a
combination of written work and demoing the programs you created in the
previous lab session.

For each lab report, we will give a **0-4** score along with feedback:

- **4** for a complete submission with high code and writing quality with few
  mistakes, and no significant errors
- **3** for a complete submission with some mistakes or some unclear writing
- **2** for a submission that is mostly complete, but with significant errors
  or demonstrating significant misunderstanding
- **1** for a submission missing several key components, or with clear
  inaccuracies in multiple components
- **0** for no submission or a submission unrecognizable as a partial or complete submission

After each lab report is graded, you'll have a chance to *resubmit* it based on
the feedback you received, which will detail what you need to do to increase
your score.

- For an original score of **0** or **1**, you can raise your score to **2** (but not to **3**)
- For an original score of **2** or **3**, you can raise your score to **4**

This is also the only late policy for lab reports. Unsubmitted lab reports are
initially given a **0**, and can get a maximum of **2** points on resubmission.

### Lecture and Discussion Sessions

Lecture sessions are FILL

### Programming

There is required programming practice every week. FILL

### Exams

FILL exams

The exams will be administered through
[PrairieLearn](https://www.prairielearn.com/about); we will give you practice
exams and exercises so you can get used to the format we'll use before you take
the first one. The exams will have a mix of questions; they will typically
include some that involve programming and interacting with a terminal.

There are N exams during the quarter in weeks FILL. On each you'll
get a **Full Pass** (2 points), **Partial Pass** (1 point), or
**Try Again** (0 points) as your score.

We don't have a traditionally-scheduled final exam for this course (you can
ignore the block provided in Webreg).  Instead, in the last week, you'll have
the opportunity to retake **up to two** of the exams from during the quarter to
improve your score up to a **Full Pass** regardless of the score on the first
attempt. The retakes may be different than the original exam, but will test the
same learning outcomes. This is also the only make-up option for missed exams
during the quarter: if you miss an exam for any reason it will be scored as 0,
and you can use one of your retake opportunities on that exam.

## Grading

Each component of the course has a minimum achievement level to get an A, B, or
C in the course. You must reach that achievement level in _all_ of the
categories to get an A, B, or C.

- **A** achievement:
    - 4 or more lab participation (out of 5 labs)
    - At least 16 total lab report points (e.g. any scores that add up to 16: [4, 4, 3, 3, 2], [4, 4, 4, 2, 2], [4, 4, 4, 4, 0], [4, 3, 3, 3, 3] etc)
    - At least NN total exam points
- **B** achievement:
    - 3 lab participation
    - At least 13 total lab report points (e.g. any scores that add up to 13: [3, 3, 3, 2, 2], [4, 3, 3, 2, 1], [4, 4, 4, 1, 0], etc)
    - At least NN total exam points
- **C** achievement:
    - 2 lab participation
    - At least 8 total assignment points
    - At least NN total exam points
