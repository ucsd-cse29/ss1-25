# UCSD CSE29 Summer Session 1 Syllabus and Logistics

- [Olivia Weng](https://www.oliviaweng.com/) (Instructor)
- [Joe Gibbs Politz](https://jpolitz.github.io) (Instructor)

CSE29 introduces you to systems programming: 1) the basics of how programs
execute on a computer, 2) programming in C with direct access to memory and
system calls, 3) software tools to manage and interact with code and programs.

This is a placeholder FAQ page for now; at the start of the summer session this
page will become the official syllabus with links to readings, assignments, and
policies.

## FAQ/AFQ (Anticipated Frequent Questions)


**Q: Is the course remote?**

There are two offerings of the course. The one taught by Joseph (Joe) Gibbs
Politz is remote. The one taught by Olivia Weng (listed as “Staff” as of
writing this FAQ) is in-person. The course content is essentially the same: we
will share materials (and this website!).

**Q: Will the content differ across the sections?**

The assignments, lab content, and exams will be the same or equivalent across
the sections. Lectures will differ in style according to modality and
instructor but follow the same content. The only formal difference is modality
(in-person vs. remote), not content.

**Q: Will the in-person section actually be partially or fully remote even
though it doesn't say so?**

No. You **must plan to be available for the in-person components** to pass the
class for the in-person section.

**Q: Is Joe's section fully remote?**

Yes, the course is fully remote, including lectures, labs, and exams.

**Q: Can I complete the remote course from XYZ state/country/timezone?**

We don't check or verify that all services are available outside of the US (for
example, but not exclusively [PrairieLearn](https://www.prairielearn.com),
[Gradescope](https://piazza.com), remote access to USCD via `ssh`, sharing
videos on Youtube and Google Drive), so wherever you are you're responsible for
making sure you have access to these services.  Sometimes we decide somewhat
late exactly what services we will use, and we only test them from campus/from
California.  Some aspects of accessing UCSD from outside the country may
require extra steps that are your responsibility, and we won't necessarily be
able to help or come up with workarounds if something doesn't work.

Also, some course components, while remote, require **synchronous**
participation. So you need to be available, with a quality Zoom connection, for
the listed course times.

**Q: What equipment/setup do I need for the remote course?**

Most remote activities will be done over Zoom, often while using another tool
like a programming environment or [PrairieLearn](https://www.prairielearn.com).

You need a camera and a microphone so that you can participate in discussions.
You should have a setup with a good enough Zoom connection to support
screenshare and sharing your webcam; group activities in lab and lecture may
require that you work in groups and cameras will be expected to be on to
facilitate high-quality discussion.

**Q: Is there a syllabus listing the topics covered in this course that I can
show my department/school/institution?**

Yes, the content will be similar to the Fall 2024 version:
[https://ucsd-cse29.github.io/fa24/](https://ucsd-cse29.github.io/fa24/), and
that page has the relevant course outcome and syllabus information.

**Q: I am waitlisted for one of the sections at position N. What should I do?**

Come to class and do all the work as usual (you will have Canvas access to get
all the needed links) so you can be up to speed if you do get a spot. This is
aligned with [official department
policy](https://cse.ucsd.edu/undergraduate/spring-2025-undergraduate-course-updates#LateAddPolicy).

We can't make accurate predictions about chances of getting into the course
from a specific waitlist position, or control that process as instructors.

As of early June, there are plenty of available spots in the in-person section!
